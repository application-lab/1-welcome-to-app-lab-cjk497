# About Me
Hello, my name is Corbin and I am currently studying in Shanghai China for a semester, but I'm originally from the New York University New York campus. I am studying business and am looking to concentrate in finance and management. In the future, I plan to fill a business role in a tech company since I'm interested in both fields.

I enjoy playing videogames like LoL, TFT, and PUBG, however, I also like going out to eat and party. I'm interested in tennis, Esports, marketing, web design, social media, and technology.

Some skills that I have are speaking Mandarin and English, programming in HTML and CSS, playing tennis, and working in small teams. I want to learn more about Python, Javascript, Microsoft Excel, finance, consulting, and the music industry.
